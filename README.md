# Project-Review-Card
# Day13 of 30 days 30 projects challenge

## Overview:
This is a simple and stylish review card project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays customer reviews with accompanying images, names, job titles, and review texts. The project features navigation buttons to view the next, previous, or a random review.

## Structure:
HTML (index.html): Contains the structure of the web page, including review card elements and navigation buttons.

CSS (RC.css): Defines the styling of the review card and overall layout. It imports fonts from Google Fonts and uses Font Awesome for icons.

JavaScript (RC.js): Manages the logic for displaying reviews and handling navigation. It includes an array of review objects, and functions to show the current review, move to the next or previous review, and display a random review.

## Customization:
Feel free to customize the project to fit your needs:
Change Review Content: Update the reviews array in the JavaScript file with your own reviews, including names, job titles, images, and review texts.
Modify Styling: Adjust the CSS styles in the RC.css file to match your preferred color scheme or layout.
